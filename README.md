# Map Club

Map Club, provided by [Research Data Services](https://library.columbia.edu/services/research-data-services.html), is for those who want to learn more about mapping, spatial data and GIS. Open to beginners and experts, the club is a space to experiment with web-based librarys or frameworks and GIS tools. Sessions are held approximately twice a month, usually on Thursdays in room 215 on the lower level of Lehman Library. To see the schedule of upcoming sessions, check the [workshops page](https://library.columbia.edu/services/research-data-services/events.html)

## Preparation

For most sessions, a text editor will be needed.  If you do not already have one, we reccomend [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/). 

For GIS Crash Course, or other sessions using GIS please bring [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) pre-installed.  We reccomend using the current long term release (LTR).
